# Djed Historical Code

This repo contains ancient versions of Djed. These versions have been made public for historical reasons only. Their purpose was to facilitate discussions between Input Output, Emurgo and Ergo during the early stages of the research and development of Djed. They were never intended to be executed. They are buggy and not conformant with the Djed protocol that has been formally verified and described in the Djed paper. They should not be used.
